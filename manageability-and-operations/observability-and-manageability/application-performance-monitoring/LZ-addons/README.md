# When to use this asset?
 
Use this asset after youâ€™ve decided to instrument your application services with OCI APM. It highlights the main considerations when setting up APM domains, data sources, availability monitors, alarms, and related networking.
 
# How to use this asset?
 
The asset is organized into two sections:

* **[Design Decisions](files/apm-lz-design-decisions.md)**:
  * Covers key questions and options to evaluate when configuring OCI APM such as:
    * How to organize **[APM domains](files/apm-lz-design-decisions.md#domains)** for ingesting and processing end-to-end application traces
    * How to select and configure **[data sources](files/apm-lz-design-decisions.md#data-sources)** to collect trace telemetry from applications
    * How to manage **[availability monitors](files/apm-lz-design-decisions.md#availability-monitors)** to proactively test key features, endpoints, and user flows in applications
    * How to manage **[alarms](files/apm-lz-design-decisions.md#alarms)** to notify you on critical events in application telemetry or availability monitor runs
* **[Deployment Blueprint](files/apm-lz-deployment-blueprint.md)**:
    * Covers the network architecture of an APM-instrumented application, and how data sources transfer telemetry to APM as a public cloud service.
